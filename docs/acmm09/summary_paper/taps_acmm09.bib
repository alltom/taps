@article{Lu04,
	Abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a new audio medium,
called audio texture, as a means of synthesizing long audio stream
according to a given short example audio clip. The example clip
is first analyzed to extract its basic building patterns. An audio
stream of arbitrary length is then synthesized using a sequence
of extracted building patterns. The patterns can be varied in the
synthesis process to add variations to the generated sound to avoid
simple repetition. Audio textures are useful in applications such
as background music, lullabies, game music, and screen saver
sounds. We also extend this idea to audio texture restoration,
or constrained audio texture synthesis for restoring the missing
part in an audio clip. It is also useful in many applications such
as error concealment for audio/music delivery with packets loss
on the Internet. Novel methods are proposed for unconstrained
and constrained audio texture synthesis. Preliminary results are
provided for evaluation.

@article{Srinivasan98,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a technique to incorporate
psychoacoustic models into an adaptive wavelet packet scheme
to achieve perceptually transparent compression of high-quality
(44.1 kHz) audio signals at about 45 kb/s. The filter bank
structure adapts according to psychoacoustic criteria and according
to the computational complexity that is available at
the decoder. This permits software implementations that can
perform according to the computational power available in order
to achieve real time coding/decoding. The bit allocation scheme
is an adapted zero-tree algorithm that also takes input from
the psychoacoustic model. The measure of performance is a
quantity called subband perceptual rate, which the filter bank
structure adapts to approach the perceptual entropy (PE) as
closely as possible. In addition, this method is also amenable
to progressive transmission, that is, it can achieve the best
quality of reconstruction possible considering the size of the
bit stream available at the encoder. The result is a variablerate
compression scheme for high-quality audio that takes into
account the allowed computational complexity, the available bitbudget,
and the psychoacoustic criteria for transparent coding.
This paper thus provides a novel scheme to marry the results in
wavelet packets and perceptual coding to construct an algorithm
that is well suited to high-quality audio transfer for internet and
storage applications.

@article{Sinha93,
	Abstract = {This paper describes a novel wavelet based audio synthesis and coding method. The method uses optimal adaptive selection and wavelet coefficients quantization procedures together with a dynamic dictionary approach. The adaptive wavelet transform selection and transform coefficient bit allocation procedures are designed to take advantage of the masking effect in human hearing. They minimize the number of bits required to represent each frame of audio material at a fixed distortion level. The dynamic dictionary greatly reduces statistical redundancies in the audio source. Experiments indicate that the proposed adaptive wavelet selection procedure by itself can achieve almost transparent coding of monophonic compact disk (CD) quality signals (sampled at 44.1kHz) at bit rates of 64-70 kilobits per second (kb/s). The combined adaptive wavelet selection and dynamic dictionary coding procedures achieve almost transparent coding of monophonic CD quality signals at bit rates of 48-66 kb/s.},

@article{Johnston88,
	Abstract = {A 4 bit/sample transform coder is designed using a psychoacoustically derived noise masking threshold based on the short-term input spectrum of the signal. The coder has been tested in a formal subjective test involving a wide selection of monophonic audio inputs. The signals used in the test were of 15 kHz bandwidth, sampled at 32 kHz. The bit rate of the resulting coder was 128 kbits/s. The subjective test shows that the coded signal could not be distinguished from the original at that bit rate. Subsequent informal work suggests that a bit rate of 96 kbits/s may maintain transparency for the set of inputs used in the test.},

@article{Pasero05,
	Abstract = {The selection of the wavelet packet best basis of a perceptual real-time audio encoder has been a challenging task for researchers. Due to the subjective nature of the auditory masking phenomenon, fully objective performance measures (entropy versus SNR, delay, etc) are not sufficient for the selection of optimal representations. In our work we present a DSP application by means of which we can measure, for each hybrid wavelet packet basis resulting from a predetermined library of wavelet filters, the bitrate of a perceptually transparent coding of the audio input and the overall filter bank delay. The novelty is that the transparency of the compression is established with a subjective evaluation. The tool user can customize both the filter bank parameters and the psychoacoustic model parameters by means of a MATLAB(R) graphical interface and listen in real-time to the reconstructed signal. The audio codec runs in real-time on a TI TMS320C6711(TM) disk. },

@phdthesis{Fitz00,
	Abstract = {    We introduce a highly manipulable, high fidelity additive sound model capable of representing transient sounds and sounds having significant nonsinusoidal energy. We represent sounds as a collection of bandwidth- enhanced partials having sinusoidal and noise- like characteristics. Partials are defined by a trio of synchronized breakpoint envelopes specifying the time- varying amplitude, center frequency, and noise content. Breakpoints for the partial envelopes are obtained by following ridges on a time-frequency surface computed by the method of reassignment. The Reassigned Bandwidth-Enhanced Model yields greater resolution in time and frequency than conventional additive techniques, and preserves noise-like and transient signals, even in modified reconstruction. },
