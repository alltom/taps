Section 1
---
[audio segment 1.a]: example of clapping created in Taps
(paragraph 2) "Hence, the generated sound should be arbitrarlily close 
to or different from the original sounds, based on the user's intention. 
Naive approaches such as repeatedly playing or combining raw segments of 
original sounds do not sound convincing..."


Section 2
---
no audio segments.


Section 3
---
[audio segment 3.a]:  pipeline example of taking a sound scene through 
all phases, with multiple endings/results.  this should match the text 
(or vice versa) in the section.  it may be nice to have two complete 
examples here.


Section 4
---
4.1
[audio segment 4.a]: yes.  something to go with figure 3: separating 
sinusoidal tracks from stochastic residue.

[audio segment 4.b]: group example?  two overlapping groups separated.

[audio segment 4.c]: 2 or 3 short examples of sinusoidal extraction, 
maybe with different parameters?

4.2
[audio segment 4.d]: yes.  something to go with figure 4: transient removal 
and hole filling.

[audio segment 4.e]: contrast transient suppression with wavelet-based
hole filling.


Section 5
---
[audio segment 5.a]: frequency warping examples.
  one for det. one for trans.

[audio segment 5.b]: time-stretching.
  one for det. one for trans.

[audio segment 5.c]: temporal placement.
  one for det. one for trans.


Section 6
---
6.1
[audio segment 6.a]: crowd examples.
  birds, clapping, ??

6.2
[audio segment 6.b]: wavelet tree synthesis example, varying parameters 
(maybe, since this is already in video).


Section 8
---
[audio segment 8.a]: result 1

[audio segment 8.b]: result 2

[audio segment 8.c]: result 3

[audio segment 8.d]: results for table 1.  generating background of 
arbitrary length; effects of modified wavelet tree.

[audio segment 8.e]: evaluation.  depends on which evaluation method we use.
