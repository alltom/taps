Outline and stufffffff

Actual outline:

Title:

Introduction: (Tell me if this is wrong)

- Musique concrete, one of the earliest forms of electronic music, 
emerged in the 1940s and 50s, pioneered by Pierre Schaeffer and others.
It involved manipulating tape recordings of sounds, often sounds that 
were not associated with music. Manipulations included changing the 
speed of segments, looping them, cutting and pasting them in different 
arrangements, reversing them, and so on. So they were all time-domain 
techniques?
- Eventually shifted to digital sampling instead of magnetic tape 
manipulations. 
- And this paved the way for other types of electronic music?

- Acoustic ecology -- other end of spectrum, almost. It seems to have 
been started as a movement for people to listen to existing natural 
soundscapes. (This is confusing, because most "acoustic ecology" info I 
found followed these lines - except the UBC acoustic ecology project, 
which seemed much broader and more relevant, but didn't mention any 
references for the broader definition. What is it really?!)
- Murray Schafer (clearly a reincarnation of Schaeffer) - "The tuning of 
the world"; Barry Truax - "Handbook of acoustic ecology"
- According to Truax, this acoustic ecology deal led to a style of 
electroacoustic music that he terms soundscape composition - creating 
realistic soundscapes from recordings, highlighting key aspects of it 
that a listener might otherwise miss/ignore.
- "One of the most obvious traits is not that the pieces use 
environmental sound materials, but rather that most pieces can be placed 
on a continuum between what might be called 'found sound' and 
'abstracted' approaches." Also writes that while "contemporary signal 
processing techniques can easily render such sounds unrecognizable and 
completely abstract", that is not soundscape composition. (Ironically, 
from this perspective, musique concrete could be rather abstract?)

- Well, tapestrea is exciting partly because you can start with your 
favourite environmental sounds/recordings, and use this one framework 
to produce sound anywhere on the 'found' to 'unrecognizable' continuum.
- But if it's more on the found end, it can still be changed in subtle 
ways (like by varying event density) and/or lengthened to whatever 
amount you want.
- And if what you want is more on the unrecognizable end, then you have 
a whole range of manipulations beyond time-domain techniques. (Time 
and frequency scaling, event placement and randomness options.)
- In fact, same set of techniques in both cases, since they are not 
discrete...
- There must be more to say here in a better way.

Related work:
- Is the same work still related? (Maybe we can at least skip the list 
of previous siggraph sound papers. That leaves sound texture synthesis 
and sinusoidal modeling.)
- Granular synthesis (It is time-domain, we have different time and 
frequency scales. Related to when we synthesize events in a loop at 
high density?)

Method: 
- Load sound
- Extract reusable components/templates (sinusoidal analysis + grouping, 
transients, residue)
- Compose with them (frequency/time transformations on individual 
components, using event distribution parameters to shape the whole 
sound, wavelet resynthesis)
- Here we may also add scripting ("score language" aka chuck) if it
works. More effects from stk would be cool too if possible, though 
maybe not in a week.
- Optionally quantize pitches to a scale... uh, shouldn't take too  
long, right? 
- Interface allows interactive analysis/synthesis. 
- Is it reasonable to have more focus on synthesis here, keeping in mind 
that this sort of synthesis is possible only because of the preceding 
analysis? Or is the analysis still interesting in this setting?

Evaluation / Results: 
- Yes? No? 
- Sound samples?

Conclusion: 
- Summary
- Future work -> can it be used live if it stops crashing?
- Something deep

References: 
- musique concrete: original papers seem to be in french and out of 
reach, but some other paper referred to "Computer Music Experiments, 
1964" by Risset, 1985, Computer Music Journal 9(1). Not sure of relevance
- truax papers on soundscape composition?
- chuck papers (all of them and also Ge's thesis)
- algorithm reference papers 

The end:
- Fill out

--------------------------------------------------------------
stuffffffff to make it look longer (and to act as the outline
of the outline):
--------------------------------------------------------------
Instructions:

- Musique concrete: read historical papers on
- Acoustic ecology
- Granular synthesis (eg the event resynthesis): but while granular
  synthesis is time-domain, we have different time and frequency scales
- Show that this is a nice workbench for these
- New things (computer assisted human guided scene analysis, siggraph
  stuff)
- "initially developed for production sound design"
- Need good title without "TAPESTREA"

- Quantize pitches to a scale
- Finish scripting; refer to as "score language" (yay, can cite chuck
  papers for this)


Random ideas awaiting garbage collection:

--- on submission ---

- Relate it to musique concrete
- Make sure paper is different from siggraph submission
- Ge wanted to submit a video, but it probably shouldn't be the siggraph
  video. Maybe instead we could record and show the "making" of a
  musical composition through the analysis and synthesis stages,
  especially if it were a decent piece and used most of our features?
- Can we try to do a performance? This is of course Ge's idea. I guess it
  may not feel like a recital if we do it together... but probably it
  would depend on the state of the software, speaking of which:

--- on implementation ---

- Finish adding ChucK scripting
- Add more DSP options in synthesis, like simple but cool filters?
- Make sliders and timeline more controllable somehow
- What else?
