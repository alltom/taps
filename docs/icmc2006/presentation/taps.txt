Hi Perry,

Here's the current (subject to change) outline and other things.

We think it would be good to have just a few introductory slides and a long series of demos that Ge and I take turns to astound the audience with.
The demo outline is included below (right after the slide outline). Any thoughts?

Also, can we meet later tomorrow? We're both likely to be working late tonight...

Thanks!


Slide 1
---
Motivation
- Musique Concrete
- Acousmatics
- Sound Design

Slide 2
---
Goal: a single framework for transforming recorded sounds on multiple levels

- results lie anywhere on the found to unrecognizable continuum

Slide 3 (not sure about order of 3, 4, 5)
---
Introducing TAPESTREA
- idea of interactively extracting reusable templates
- transforming them independently
- recombining them in different ways

this is re-composition

Slide 4
---
Related work
- spectral modeling (serra et al)
- granular synthesis (truax, roads)
- dubnov
- transient analysis, auditory scene analysis, sound editors...

Slide 5
---
Very brief overview of taps

- 3 types of sounds
- separate methods for analysis and synthesis
- UI

Slide 6
---
Transformations
- massive freq and time
- density and periodicity

Slide 7-9 (could go after the demo?)
---
Conclusion / Contributions / Future work


Demo (this is also where we explain relevant technical details)

1. basic tour of analysis
- load a file
- show waveform and then specgram
- play the thing (toggle to spectrum)
- select a region, extract
- play back deterministic + residue
- save
- select another, extract
- play back deterministic + residue
- save
- show library view with saved templates

2. advanced analysis
- load a second file or use the same one
- det sliders, magnitude and tilt, #...
- extract baby (or other challenging sound)
- transients
- extract baby (or other challenging sound)
- transients
- extract easy transient
- show residue and explain the cavity filling
- talk about groups and raw and briefly, maybe extract raw

3. synthesis part 1
- move into face
- explain the different parts of the face
- load more stuff
- explain different types of templates
- ding and baby
- residue
- transients
- raw?

4. synthesis part 2
- ding loop
- 1 period
- change density
- freq warp time stretch
- quantize, use script
- timelines
- overload the time line with det, tra, loops, time lines
- mixed bag

5. scripting
- scripts
- bus example
- auto example
- joystick example
