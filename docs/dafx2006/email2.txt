      EDITION NOTES

______ Edition notes about text format, layout & fonts:
- The paper format is A4 instead of letter paper format.
   -> LaTeX users should use the last templates, WITH the command
      \usepackage{dafx_06,amssymb,amsmath} INSTEAD of
      \usepackage[A4]{dafx_06,amssymb,amsmath}.
      When changing the format from A4 to letter, your text will seem  
longer:
      this implies to shorten your text so as to fit the required  
length (6 pages
      for oral presentation, 4 pages for poster).

[DONE, NEEDS SHORTENING AS EXPECTED]

______ Edition notes about PDF hyperref & bookmarks:
- Hyperref are not working.
   -> Possible reason: LaTeX compilation without pdftex.
      please use only one of the latest templates: they all use  
hyperrefs.
- Bookmark does not exist.
   -> Possible reason: LaTeX compilation without pdftex.
      please use only one of the latest templates: they all use  
hyperrefs.

[DONE, USED JPGS AND PDFLATEX]

______ Edition notes about title:
- Non uniform layout for the authors email addresses.
   -> In order to have the same layout for all papers in the  
proceedings,
      please use "{AAA|BBB|CCC}@DDD" for several emails with  
identical affiliation.

[DONE]

______ Edition notes about figures:
- Text is too small for all figures.
   -> Please be careful to the font size in your figures. Figure font  
size should not be
      smaller than 9pt, and if possible they should be identical to  
the text font size. For
      example, to do so using Matlab, you can use the subplot(X,Y,N)  
command before plotting
      (X lines, Y columns): the text font size will proportionally  
get bigger.
- Captions must be italic for all figures.
- All color figures are difficult to read when printed in grey scale  
or black & white.
   -> Please use grey scale or black & white figures, with  
appropriate legend. For example
      when generating sonograms with Matlab, you may use: "colormap 
(gray);" or even better:
      "colormap(flipud(gray));" (the latter saves black ink).
- Figures are not vectorial & are poor quality.
   -> Please avoid using low quality figures (bitmap, pixellized,  
screen copy). Vectorial
      figures (e.g. using postscript or pdf) make a noticeable  
quality difference when
      printed or viewed on the screen. Otherwise, use 150 dpi  
pixellized figures.
