Dear DAFx-06 author,

I would like to inform you that we did some improvements of the LaTeX  
"dafx_06.sty" file (attached) as well as the templates (on the web  
site: http://www.dafx.ca/dafx06_templates.html).

You do NOT need to update (we will use this style for the proceedings  
making) your files, EXCEPT if having problems when compiling with  
usual "latex" and not "pdfeTeX".

Please feel free to contact me for further information, help on the  
edition, etc.

Regards,
--

_____________________________
For your information, the update of "dafx_06.sty" is solving 2 issues:
1- an error with the title that was not automatically in upper case,
2- an error when using the two author template, with an extra space  
for the second author.

There also is a minor change in each template, concerning an error  
with automatic detection of use of "latex" or "pdftex" that is now  
solved thanks to authors feedback.
