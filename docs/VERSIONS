0.1.0.7 

  - (added) command line option to have a white background on all faces:
            taps --whitebg
  - (added) alternative background synthesis method using randomized 
            overlap-add [Froejd & Horner, ICMC 2007]

0.1.0.6

  - (fixed) reduced clickiness of loop synthesis (also in 0.1.0.5 FIXES)
  - (fixed) crashing of --nogui mode on mac os x (also in 0.1.0.5 FIXES)
  - (fixed) over-zealous renaming of "copied" templates when not copied by user
  - (fixed) some timeline issues: (a) copying, (b) stopping and replaying,
            (c) deleting one and selecting another one
  - (fixed) copying transient and raw templates with new ids
  - (fixed) crashes on analysis of mic input segment including endpoints
  - (added) boundary checks for shifting (moving) tracks out of time / 
            frequency bounds in group face
  - (added) optionally save (& read) templates as (& from) XML files.
            when saved from analysis face, this also stores analysis
            information and parameters in the XML file. the XML template 
            files can also be modified directly, including by adding your 
            own fields that Taps will ignore.
  - (added) small buttons for quitting TAPESTREA and toggling fullscreen 
            (when applicable) at the top right corner of each face.

0.1.0.5

  - (fixed) examples/templates/script/chuiexample1.ck
  - (fixed) memory leaks in analysis face
  - (fixed) spectrum display during file playback in analysis face
  - (fixed) showing current value of every slider
  - (fixed) templates created by copying an existing template in the 
            synthesis face now have a name ending with "copy" or "loop"    
  - (added) brand new GROUP FACE for grouping and editing tracks, by Tom 
            Lieber
  - (added) recording some amount of audio directly into the analysis face
  - (added) zooming in and out of the spectrogram in the analysis face
  - (added) selection of fft size and analysis window size from analysis 
            face 
            (warning: may cause interesting bugs)
  - (added) new command line options:
	    --outchannels N : to set # of real-time audio output channels
	    --inchannels N : to set # of real-time audio input channels
	    --bufsize N : to set real-time audio output buffer size
	    --maxrecord x : to set the maximum number of seconds of audio 
              recorded in one go in the analysis face 
	    --overtracking x : to find extra peaks per frame before saving 
	      the specified number of sine tracks
  - (added) ability to start timeline's synthesis mid-template, aka 
            "fastforwarding" a timeline to start at the point to which its 
            left indicator is set
            (warning: still buggy if timeline is repeatedly started while 
            already playing)

0.1.0.4

  (Several new features introduced, but all quite experimental.)

  - (fixed) no more high CPU usage on reverb tails on Intel processors
  - (fixed) can now have ".ck" in path names
  - (added) 8-channel output 
			- number of real-time audio output channels can be set to 
			  N by command line: --channels N
			- 8 audio buses within taps, can write to 8-channel wav file
			  while playing in stereo
			- template can be played on specific bus from chuck script
  - (added) chui: chuck gui
			- add user interface elements from chuck scripts 
  - (added) sample rate conversion
			- works by default in windows
			- install libsamplerate and recompile for Mac OS X, Linux
  - (added) new command line option: --nogui
			- instead of running gui, synthesis can be controlled from 
			  the command line using two or  more terminals. the first 
			  acts as a server that receives messages from the rest on which 
			  templates to add, remove, play or stop.

0.1.0.3

  - (fixed) sneaky scripting bug
  - (fixed) problems with saving files as templates from synthesis face
  - (fixed) default max frame rate set to 30 Hz, no longer eats 80% CPU
  - (added) buttons to navigate between faces (upper right corner)
  - (added) standard transformations for files loaded in synthesis face
  - (added) more command line arguments 
			--frate N : to set frame rate
			--dir x : to set working directory ("write to file" writes here)
			--version : to see current version and exe target
			--help or --about : to see version and usage info
  - (added) default and sticky directories for open/save dialog boxes
            (when opening from GUI shell instead of command line)
  - (removed) unused treesynth face (from project)

---
0.1.0.2
  
  - (fixed) disappearing "now" indicator on analysis waveform display
  - (fixed) saving templates as .wav or .tap files from analysis face
  - (added) universal binaries for mac os x support
  - (removed) broken script example
  - (removed) extra 'save' button on analysis face

---
0.1.0.1

  - (fixed) code changes to improvement portability (t_CK -> t_TAP)
  - (fixed) compilation without native libsndfile (osx)
  - (fixed) compilation on gcc-4 in (osx)
  - (fixed) transient playback gain in synthesis face
