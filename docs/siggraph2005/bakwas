It was a nice day. Mr. Groucho sat on the porch of his secluded sea-side 
home and listened to the ocean waves and the chirping of birds. He did not 
like the birds. They chirped in a manner he found extremely annoying. He 
wished he could enjoy the sound of the waves without the birds, maybe hear 
some kids playing on the beach instead. Perhaps an occasional train 
passing by to remind him he wasn't too far from the rest of the world. And 
possibly, if it wasn't asking for too much, birds with chirps more tuned 
in to his auditory tastes. Yeah, that would be nice. And also impossible, 
since he was stuck in this cottage listening to birds who didn't know how 
to chirp. Mr. Groucho gave up and wept.

This is where Sound Scene Modeling: ____ ____ ____ came into the picture. 
It claimed that it could give Mr. Groucho exactly what he wanted. Mr. 
Groucho didn't believe it, but saw in this a good opportunity to make 
other people feel bad. So he said in a nasty voice, "I bet you can't." The 
bet was on. Who will win?
