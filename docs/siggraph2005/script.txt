INTRODUCTION
(10 seconds)

[narrator]: 

  - motivation
    - we are sensitive to details/events in a sound scene,
	  even adding/removing details/events can place the listener in a very different environment
  - challenges
    - sound is complex
	- an out-of-box resynthesis does not offer enough control
	  (want to separate a particular sound, for example)
  - what we address
    - we present a technique to model sound scenes by example: 
    - separate existing "sound scenes" into 
      - D
	  - T
	  - S
    - which can be used as templates to build sound scenes



[narrator]: we are able to do ...

ANALYSIS

example (garbage)
- on loading a sound, we see its waveform & spectrogram
- we can also view a frame-by-frame spectrum
	- observe the changing spectral characteristics of the sound over time [play short sound]
	- deterministic events are easy to locate - peaks
- separate the sound into deterministic and stochastic parts (and transient) [click separate]
- now we can listen to the components separately [play event and residue]
    - (we could point out how the spectrum for the det. event has only the peaks while the residue spectrum
	  has these peaks flattened out, but i think we shouldn't waste time on that unless we have nothing else to say)

more involved example 
- our tool also makes it easy to extract specific events. [load different sound file]
- selecting a rectangle on the sgram causes the analysis to be performed only in the specified time & freq range
  so you can grab the event you want 
  [switch views] [maybe separate without changing any other parameters for the sake of comparison]
- other controls [sneakily adjust these for your sound file while you describe these]
	- thresholds for deterministic events
		- threshold - lower bound for magnitude
		- tilt - being able to apply different lower bounds for different frequencies
		- peak-to-noise ratio - how loud an event should be compared to the average loudness of the frame?
	- controls for tracking events
		- minpoints - an event should be at least this long to be extracted
		- maxgap - (ignore?) to account for brief pauses within an event
		- freq-sense - (ignore?) acceptable range for changes in an event's frequency (pitch?) across time
- and now [separate] - the sound you wanted! (rephrase...:)...)


SYNTHESIS

having extracted a collection of deterministic events, transients and background, we can now use these to construct
sound scenes.

[we are now in synthesis face]

[do the appropriate actions that will construct the scene we have in mind]:
- [pick a residue and listen to it] background brought to you by enhanced wavelet tree learning
- [pick a determinstic event and listen to it] event brought to you by sinusoidal synthesis
  - [apply transformations and listen to result] brought to you by SMS
- [pick a transient and listen to it] woohoo. we never thought we'd be doing this.
- [pick an event and loop it] we can loop events! 
	- periodic or random
	- optional random changes to freq-warp, time-stretch, gain and pan
	- density (events per second / minute / hour / other duration)
- [make a new timeline, add stuff] we can add templates to a timeline and save the timeline itself as a template [save
	timeline as template] and add it to a newer timeline of longer duration [do that too].
- [do whatever else we need for the final sound]
- [sit back, shut up and enjoy the show]

- [synthesize some applause]

second synthesis example? - something from the same analysis templates, but mixed to sound different.
- point out the sounds are from different sources
- [show sndpeek]
