how much background?

tom:
- 2 non-specialist
- 3 specialist (but 2 non-specialist will be the ones arguing for/against us)
- show how it's better
- respond to methodology
- graphics learn from sound, vice versa - this is important

tom:
- main contribution = separation into events
- first one to do this?
- sms for completely different purpose
- maybe also use this graphics?  (nope)

adam:
- visual texture synthesis?
- pertinent to design of games

diego:
- yes, for game programmer

tom:
- precedence:
- aero-dynamic sound was top-ranked paper
- clear observation, insight
- why graphics people would be interested in this?

misha:
- wang tiles?  (nope)

tom/adam:
- there are many parallel  (none seems useful though)

ananya:
- which figures to add? change?

misha:
- figure 1: synthesize 3 types of sound
- transient events needs to be better defined

benedict:
- section 4 - sms figures (simple illustration)

phil:
- human control or automated?

ge:
- generate similar texture out of box, but human controllable

joshua:
- texture graphics - I don't really care about control

jason:
- need to show video with sliders
- turn up the birds turn up the cars
- here is orginal corpus of audio
- here are the events
- you are listening to real-time audio
- and we are demonstrating the points of our interface
- here you will here more foreground events

misha:
- have animation

tom:
- video show in situation that graphics people care about

tom:
- more than two things
- separation
- system

misha:
- maybe a system paper
- sms + wavelet tree

tom:
- system paper means more compelling results
- video shows person watching video with sliders

mike:
- it wasn't clear why video game companies need this
- maybe more interesting in film setting - post production
- video game companies have stock sounds

forrester:
- ambients loops bad
- cross fade bad
- texture synthesis good!

phil:.
- movie is artistic control, why would they need this, which is 
semi-automated

tom:
- if talking about games and movies
  if features records the real-world separately anyway,
  separation is unnecessary
 
jason:
- but this could change the ways we record for video games and movies...

shirley:
- even with recording, this can be useful
- augment clapping
- this is what a user could do
- user study: reconstruct this scene (boos/applause)


more notes:
ui: multi-sliders with distribution for each event
out of box - out texture resembles in texture as much as possible
results need to awe the reviewers
