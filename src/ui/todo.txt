SYNTHESIS

timeline:
- scaling
- length
- change/move/delete items from the timeline
- map height to something? (pan?) (loudness?) (frequency of crash?)
- tick marks

library:
- delete items from the library
- scrollbar? border?
- save and load
- sort (name, type)? search? and destroy?
- scripts???  (no!)

loop:
- periodicity and poisson, transition

transient:
- phase vocoder


ANALYSIS

- should be faster and be able to handle bigger files
- finalize cube not spinning / add progress indicator cube
- zoom on waveform / spectrum
- cache fft's for entire file, or as we take them?

bugs:
- it's perfect
- except for: 
    - fix hit detection (butters) (synthesis)
	- residue put on timeline sounds weird (but doesn't crash as often as it used to)(++)
    - sometimes the program (analysis + synthesis) crashes right when you start it (thread error)
	- overlap add when writing residue file (loudness strange?) (analysis) (we are almost happy for now)

potential bugs/features:
- make sure it still works on other OS's
- uncrashability
