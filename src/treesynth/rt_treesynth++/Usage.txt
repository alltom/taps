Usage:

rt_treesynth++ orig.wav uses orig.wav as the original source file. Other knobs:

-p <number> computes the threshold epsilon using <number> as the percentage. 
-o <filename> specifies <filename> as the output file
-k <number> specifies the fraction of predecessors to consult at each level
-l <filename> specifies <filename> as the "left" file. If not specified, the original source file is used.
-r if included allows a random flip while copying the first level of the tree into the new tree
-a <1/0> if set to 1 or not specified, does ancestor learning first; if set to 0, does predecessor learning first
